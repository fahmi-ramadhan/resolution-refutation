# Rules for course eligibility and graduation
# If someone has math prerequisites and is enrolled in calculus, they are eligible for the advanced course
has_math_prereq & enrolled_in_calculus > eligible_for_advanced_course

# If someone is eligible for the advanced course OR has CS prerequisites, they can take the database course
eligible_for_advanced_course | has_cs_prereq > can_take_database

# Graduation requires either database OR advanced course
wants_to_graduate > can_take_database | eligible_for_advanced_course

# A student passes the semester if and only if they study hard AND attend all classes
passes_semester = studies_hard & attends_all_classes

# Negation example: If a student doesn't attend all classes, they won't receive participation credit
!attends_all_classes > !receives_participation_credit

# A student is either focusing on programming or theory, not both
focusing_on_programming | focusing_on_theory
!(focusing_on_programming & focusing_on_theory)
